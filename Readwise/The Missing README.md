## Highlights

- Everyone begins as an entry-level engineer. To advance, you’ll need to be competent in several core areas. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XM2CDZM&location=511))
- Contribute by filling in documentation gaps you find in the onboarding process. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XM2CDZM&location=535))
  - Note: Even when you are new and inexperienced - you still can add value. It can also help guide your ramp-up by probiding clearity to the uninitiated (i.e. You and future new hires)
- If your company doesn’t have a new hire program, ask your manager to explain the “org chart” (who is in charge of what and who reports to whom), the different departments, and how they relate; ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XM2CDZM&location=538))
- The point is not to write a perfect document but rather to write enough to trigger a discussion that fleshes out the details. This is a variation of Cunningham’s law, which states that “the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08XM2CDZM&location=542))
  - Note: Develop a growth mindset. At first go articulate what you understand and share your knowledge as if to quiz your understanding. others who have a deeper understanding or are compelled to correct your comprehension will correct you. Take no offence. You win either way.
