## Highlights

- The first edition included historical information that I removed later to improve focus. If you’re interested in Linux and how it relates to the history of Unix, pick up Peter H. Salus’s The Daemon, the Gnu, and the Penguin (Reed Media Services, 2008). ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X7S1JMB&location=926))
  - Note: The recommeneded book covers how the software we used evolved over time.
- The most effective way to understand how an operating system works is through abstraction—a fancy way of saying that you can ignore most of the details that make up a piece that you’re trying to understand, and concentrate instead on its basic purpose and operation. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07X7S1JMB&location=939))
  - Note: Can't see the forest for the trees... All too often one may get fixated on a particular component where in it of itself is a whole "process" and is distracted by this instead of understanding "just-enough" to continue the flow of understanding the system as a whole.
