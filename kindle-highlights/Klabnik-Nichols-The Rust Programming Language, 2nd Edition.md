## Highlights

Run `rustc --version` in the command prompt: this command will output the version of Rust installed on your system if Rust is installed. If Rust is not installed, you will likely see an error message indicating that rustc is not recognized as a command.

Currently I have: `rustc 1.68.0 (2c8cc3432 2023-03-06)` ^ref-29512

> This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.62.0 (released 2022-06-30) or later with edition="2021" in the Cargo.toml file of all projects to configure them to use Rust 2021 edition idioms. — location: [1362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0B7QTX8LL&location=1362)
