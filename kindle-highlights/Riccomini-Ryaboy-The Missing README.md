Contribute by filling in documentation gaps you find in the onboarding process. — location: [535](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08XM2CDZM&location=535) ^ref-39902

Even when you are new and inexperienced - you still can add value. It can also help guide your ramp-up by providing clarity to the uninitiated (i.e. You and future new hires)

The point is not to write a perfect document but rather to write enough to trigger a discussion that fleshes out the details. This is a variation of Cunningham’s law, which states that “the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08XM2CDZM&location=542) ^ref-36121

Develop a growth mindset. At first go articulate what you understand and share your knowledge as if to quiz your understanding. others who have a deeper understanding or are compelled to correct your comprehension will correct you. Take no offence. You win either way.
