## Highlights

HTML structures the text and images that make up a website’s content so that a browser can render, or display, that content for a user to view. The HTML code itself is just a text file, but when an HTML file is opened in a browser, it tells the browser to format and display content as a web page. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QGN34N7&location=343) ^ref-52925

CSS is what gives HTML files their colors, features, and (some may even say) character! CSS is the language that allows us to assign different types of HTML content a specific look and feel. You can think of CSS as a set of visual guidelines that tell the browser how each HTML element needs to look on a web page. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QGN34N7&location=393) ^ref-35637
