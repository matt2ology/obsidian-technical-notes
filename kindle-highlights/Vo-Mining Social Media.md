## Highlights

HTML structures the text and images that make up a website’s content so that a browser can render, or display, that content for a user to view. The HTML code itself is just a text file, but when an HTML file is opened in a browser, it tells the browser to format and display content as a web page. — location: [343](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07QGN34N7&location=343) ^ref-52925
