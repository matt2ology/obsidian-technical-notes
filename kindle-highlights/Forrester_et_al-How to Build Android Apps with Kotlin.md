The programming language you will use throughout this course to create Android apps is Kotlin. Previously the standard language to create Android apps was Java. Since Google I/O 2017 (the annual Google developer conference), this has been Google’s preferred language for Android app development. — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVZX4JHS&location=606) ^ref-46702

Kotlin was created to address some of the shortcomings of Java in terms of verbosity, handling null types, and adding more functional programming techniques, amongst many other issues. — location: [611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVZX4JHS&location=611) ^ref-5871

Project configuration — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVZX4JHS&location=636) ^ref-35991

- Package name: An address ID for source code and assets in app. Best to name this as clear and descriptive and related to what the application accomplishes. This can be accomplished sub domains (e.g. com.business.shop.candyshop). The "Name" value of the app, in lower case with spaces removed, is then appended to the domain.

A typical manifest file, in general terms, is a top-level file that describes the enclosed files or other data and associated metadata that forms a group or unit. The Android manifest applies this concept to your Android app as an XML file. — location: [787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVZX4JHS&location=787) ^ref-50559

- Contains all the metadata of the application as an XML file.

---

The key permission that most apps require is access to the internet. This is not added by default. — location: [815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BVZX4JHS&location=815) ^ref-34314

- To enable internet permissions: this is made possible by configuring the Android manifest, so a WebView can be rendered onto screen.

1 - Switch tabs to the MainActivity class. From the main project window, it’s located at app | java | com | example | myapplication.

2 - Change `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)` to `setContentView(webView)`
