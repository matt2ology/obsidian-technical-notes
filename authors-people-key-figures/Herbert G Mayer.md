# Herbert G. Mayer

Part-time professor of Sacramento State's Computer Science Department. He taught my
CSC 139 - [Operating System Principles](../4-hub-notes-üöâ/Operating%20Systems.md) during my 2022 fall semester.

The time he was able to have in-person lectures it was clear that he cared for students,
loved teaching, and promoted a growth mindset and a safe learning environment.

Your encouragement to forgive yourself when mistakes were made and to grow from it
especially when working in tech is very much appreciated when I doubt with my own
skills and abilities.

Professor Mayer is the professor who can make teaching Operating Systems fun and exciting.

You are missed. You are remembered. Rest in Peace Herbert G. Mayer.

Herbert Georg Mayer

December 12, 1943 - September 26, 2022

Herbert‚Äôs parents, Ernst Herbert and Eva Mayer, met during WW II when his father, a German soldier, was stationed in Norway. Eva Mayer, the youngest of 10 children, was a spunky girl who fell in love, left her large family, and moved to Germany in the middle of the war. Herbert was their first child, born in Bad H√∂nnigen, a small village on the right bank of the Rhine River near the border with Belgium.

After being transferred from the safety of Norway to fight in France, his father was wounded and taken prisoner by US forces in the famous Battle of the Bulge. Herbert was almost two years old before his father returned home at the end of the war. In the meantime, Eva managed to escape danger and kept her baby safe in a war torn country. She put her resourcefulness to work sewing dresses in exchange for food using old clothes sent to her by her Norwegian relatives. She unraveled sweaters to knit clothing for her baby, and ripped apart shirts, suits, dresses and pants to sew clothing to sell. By the time her husband returned home, emaciated from years of imprisonment, she had a larder full of meats ready to revive him physically and spiritually.

Herbert grew into a man in the image of his mother: confident, hard-working, and brimming over with exuberant love of life and people. He twinkled and smiled and found humor and fun in so much. Professionally, he became a computer science engineer, though he often said, in his second and third life, he wanted to be a ship builder or astronomer. His hobbies reflected these interests all his life. He sat outside almost every night with his binoculars observing what was happening in the skies, and he built ships-in-bottles of all his favorite famous ships.

Herbert was so talented, so curious about ‚Äúthe world, the universe, and everything‚Äù as he often said. He spoke five languages, published four computer science text books, immersed himself in classical music, always had a book at his bedside, and was a history and geography aficionado. Most remarkably, he never let on that his accomplishments were out of the ordinary. He so loved teaching that wherever he lived, he worked part-time teaching computer science on top of his full-time employment. His students adored him, often voluntarily telling the department chair that he was the best teacher they‚Äôd ever had.

He loved his family and considered his sisters, Astrid and Andrea, two of his best friends. And so many people loved him. He had friends all over the world and kept a record of every one of their birthdays, greeting each of them personally every year.

Eva Mayer passed her indomitable spirit to her son, who never saw a challenge he couldn‚Äôt overcome until he was defeated by pancreatic cancer. His 79 years on this earth were so full, his spirit so strong, we still feel his presence in every room and every space we‚Äôve shared with him.

Herbert is survived by his wife of 52 years, Mary; his three children, Carmen, Alexander, and Andre; his 6 grandchildren, Dorian, Penelope, Christian, Juliette, Aria, and John; his great grandson, Emile; and his beloved sister, Astrid.
