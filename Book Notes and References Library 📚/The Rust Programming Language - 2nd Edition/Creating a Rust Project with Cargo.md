After making sure that you have Rust installed

```sh
cargo --version
```

Create a project with Cargo by running the following in the terminal

```sh
cargo new <project_name>
cd <project_name>
```

This will create a new directory and project of the name we provided.
Cargo then creates two files and `src` directory with a main.rs file within it.

Cargo goes a step further it assumes that you'll be using some means of
version control, so the Cargo tool will initialize a new Git repository along
with a _.gitignore_ file; however, if an existing Git repository is already in
place Cargo won't create one when the `cargo new` command is used.

If you want to have a new Git repository within one already set you'd have to
provide the following command: `cargo new --vsc=git`; on the other hand,
if one wishes to use a different version control system or none at all they may
do the following `cargo new --help` to see the available options
