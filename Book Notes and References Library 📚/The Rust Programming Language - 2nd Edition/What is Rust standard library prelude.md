By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings 
into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude, and you can see 
everything in it at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html.

If a type you  want to use isnâ€™t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into 
scope explicitly  with a use statement. Using the std::io library provides you with a 
number of  useful features, including the ability to accept user input.

```rust
use std::io;
```
