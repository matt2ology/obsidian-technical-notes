# What is Rust Project File Structure

Cargo has a defined file structure hierarchy.

- All source code lives int he `src` folder
- The top-level directory is for the following:
  - README files
  - License information
  - Configuration files
  - Everything else not related to code

> Cargo expects your source files to live inside the src directory.
> The top-level project directory is just for README files, license information,
> configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo
> helps you organize your projects. Thereâ€™s a place for everything,
> and everything is in its place.
