# What is Rust Cargo.toml

[TOML (Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language)](../../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/TOML.md) is Cargo's configuration file.

It keeps track of the program's attributes:

- Project name
- Project's version
- Version-edition of Rust used
- Dependencies the code is using
- As the project grows it will track other keys

See more keys and their definitions at <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html>
