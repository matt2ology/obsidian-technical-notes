This tool manages Rust projects:

- Build compilation of code
- Downloading code dependencies
- Building code dependencies

Cargo build a debug executable by default and is stored in the following path of
the project folder directory: `target/debug`

Cargo commands are the same regardless of which operating system
(i.e. it works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows)
