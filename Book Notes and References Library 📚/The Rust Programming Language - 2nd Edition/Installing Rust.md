## Installing Rust on Linux or MacOS

1. Download script and start installation of the `rustup`tool: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
2. A _linker_ will let Rust join its compiled outputs into one file. A C compiler should be installed
   - If a C compiler is needed on MacOS: `xcode-select --install
   - Linux users generally install GCC or Clang respective to their distribution of Linux documentation; for example, Ubuntu uses the `build-essential` package

## Installing Rust on Windows

Instructions can be found here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
