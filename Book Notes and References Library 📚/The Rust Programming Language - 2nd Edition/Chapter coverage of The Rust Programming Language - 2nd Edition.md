- If you're meticulous start chapter 3 and return to chapter 2

Each chapter are as follows:

1. Concept: covers installation, a "Hello, world", package manager, and build tool
2. Project: intro to writing a program via a number-guessing game
3. Concept: common features similar to other programming languages
4. Concept: covers Rust ownership system
5. Concept: structs, a custom type in rust, and methods
6. Concept: enums (a custom type in rust), `match` expressions, and the `if let` control flow construct
7. Concept: Rust's module system and privacy rules for code and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces
8. Concept: Common collection data structures like vectors, strings, hash maps
9. Concept: Rust's error-handling philosophy and techniques
10. Concept: generics, traits, and lifetimes - gives the power to define code that applies to multiple types
11. Concept: testing
12. Project: build subset implementation of `grep`
13. Concept: explores closures and iterators
14. Concept: covers closures and iterators - functional programming
15. Concept: covers "smart pointers" and its traits
16. Concept: covers different models of concurrent programming and programming in multiple threads
17. Concept: Rust idioms comparison to object-oriented programming
18. Concept: reference on patters and pattern matching
19. Concept: advance topics - unsafe rust, macros; and, more on lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures
20. Project: implement a low-level multithreaded web server
