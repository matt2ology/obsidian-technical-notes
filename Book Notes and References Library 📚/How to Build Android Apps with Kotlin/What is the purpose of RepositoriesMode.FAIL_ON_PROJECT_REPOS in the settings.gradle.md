# What is the purpose of RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS in the settings.gradle

In the `dependencyResolutionManagement` block of the file 
(projectFolder/app/build.gradle.kts) setting the argument 
`RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS` into `repositoriesMode.set()`
ensures all dependencies repositories that are defined in in that section of code;
otherwise, a build error will be triggered.

```kotlin script
// projectFolder\app\build.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
