Before the update to Android 2022.2 the traditional Android
[UI](../../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/User%20Interface.md) development relied on using XML
for layout designs. Modern Android UI development is built with
[JetPack Compose](../../_inbox/JetPack%20Compose.md) where
[Kotlin](../../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/Kotlin%20Programming%20Language.md) is used to
tell what the [UI](../../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/User%20Interface.md) should present
instead of how elements should be constructed in view.

This is a declarative approach versus the, classic traditional,
imperative UI approach.
