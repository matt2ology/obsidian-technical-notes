After installing and making a new Android project: [Android Studio New Project Configuration Empty Activity](Android%20Studio%20New%20Project%20Configuration%20Empty%20Activity.md)

## Android Emulator

This is the base emulator, which can be configured to create virtual devices
of different Android makes and models.

## Android SDK Build-Tools

[Android Studio](Android%20Studio) uses "build tools" to build applications.
This involves compilation, linking, and packaging the application to prepare
for installation on a device

## Android SDK Platform

The targeted Android platform one would like to develop on: the "platform"
refers to the API level

## Android SDK Platform-Tools

Originally from the command line these tools are used to interact and debug
one's application

## Android SDK Tools

Unlike the "Android SDK Platform-Tools", the "Android SDK tools" are used
mainly from within Android Studio in order to perform certain tasks;
for example, the virtual device for running apps, and the SDK manager to
download and install platforms and other components of the SDK.

## Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)

Depending on the [OS](../../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/Operating%20Systems.md), this
hardware level feature is offered to allow the emulator run more quickly

## SDK Patch Applier v4

This enables patches to be applied to [Android Studio](Android%20Studio),
so you'll have the most-up-to-date features of
[the latest version of Android Studio released](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuruK3Li2hAMVuSCtBh0JbwkCEAAYASAAEgJ5fPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
