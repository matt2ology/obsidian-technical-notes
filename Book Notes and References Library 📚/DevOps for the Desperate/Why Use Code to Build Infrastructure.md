Automation enables an organization to efficiently and scale their compute and
operations without the need of additional skilled workers overseeing the
creation, recovery, or configuration of systems core to the application/services.

in the event of a disaster, minimizes the chances of individual, unique,
configuration errors, and enables operations to consistently, quickly, and
efficiently manage and deploy applications.
