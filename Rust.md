## .gitignore

```md
# RUST

## Generated by Cargo in Rust projects

## will have compiled files and executables

debug/

# Generated by Cargo

# will have compiled files and executables

target/

# Remove Cargo.lock from gitignore if creating an executable, leave it for libraries

# More information here https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html

Cargo.lock

# These are backup files generated by rustfmt

\*_/_.rs.bk

## MSVC Windows builds of rustc generate these, which store debugging information

\*.pdb

## Ignore all executables

\*.exe
```
