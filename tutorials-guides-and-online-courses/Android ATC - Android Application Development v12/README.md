Repo :

A dumb pay-walled, no-name certification organization, who's "e-book" isn't
downloadable and can only be viewed though their website log-in portal that is
just a basic web PDF viewer.

For certification that has more value, compared to "*Android*Â ATC"
(Advanced Training Consultants), checkout Google's own
[Associate Android Developer](https://developers.google.com/certification/associate-android-developer)
