## Django Local Development Server

Navigate to your project (the parent folder) where you can
see both the project source code subfolder and `manage.py`

```text
───website
    │   manage.py
    │
    └───website
```

Use the manage tool to "boot" the server

> python manage.py runserver

It helps to bookmark the address it provides for you
