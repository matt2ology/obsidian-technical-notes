## Resources

- [SourceMaking](https://sourcemaking.com/) : I will tell
  you a lot of stories about good software architecture and
  teach you how to create it with design patterns. I will
  guide you through anti-patterns, common pitfalls and
  mistakes that people make when they plan, create, and
  manage software projects. In the end, I will teach you
  how to smell a bad code and improve it with refactoring.
