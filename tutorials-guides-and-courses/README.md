## Note Creation Workflow - Course/Tutorial Series

Related: [Note Taking Workflow Draft](../_inbox/Note%20Taking%20Workflow%20Draft.md) <= TODO : Update and merge content into

1. Make a new folder in current directory (i.e. `tutorials-guides-and-online-courses`)
   with the convention of "author/channel-tutorialSeriesName" in kabab case
   (e.g. `authorchannelName-rust-for-beginners`).
2. In that folder, author/channel-tutorialSeriesName, create a `README` using
   the [readme_tutorial_template](../_templates/readme_tutorial_template.md).
   This will be all the will capture high level notes and key highlights to
   encapsulate what I've learned in the tutorial series.
   1. `aliases`: README - tutorial folder name
3. Create a "hub note", [hub-notes](../_templates/hub-notes.md), with the same name as the folder
   (author/channel-tutorialSeriesName). This note will serve as the "hub" for where I
   reference other related notes, related topics, my GitHub repository where I followed along,
   a link to the tutorial's playlist (if there is one), and index the notes created from
   the tutorial series.
4. All notes use the template [permanent-notes-video](../_templates/permanent-notes-video.md).
   At the top, in the properties section, provide the link to the source of the video/guide

From here any significant high level materials captured in the course's README is then
"processed" into it's own higher-level more broader topic note; for example, if the course
or tutorial was on React.JS all that course/tutorial series would "bubble-up" to the
ReactJS note

This process would continue until the notes are refined...
