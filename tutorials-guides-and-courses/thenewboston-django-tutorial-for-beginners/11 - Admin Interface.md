Django already comes with an "admin" that affords one with special privileges, but before we can use it we must create it.

## Create Django Admin

This will create an administration of the backend (access to the database).

```term
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

If we wanted to have the means of editing the database of both the album and users table we can do so within the `music` app in the `admin.py`

We need to import the Python class/table and register the Python class/table model with the admin site so we can see it in the admin site.

Now we have the ability to Create - Read - Update - Delete items in our database.

```python
# in website\music\admin.py
from django.contrib import admin

# we need this so we can register the Album model with the admin site
from .models import Album

# this is how we register the Album model with the admin site so we can see it in the admin site
admin.site.register(Album)
```
