## Introduction

- Focus on passing coding interviews for software engineering jobs
- University courses focuses on the theoretical concepts, but not often the application or (no prepare one for interview that requires implementation)
- The course is taught though examples with a mix of walkthroughs and exercises

**Each chapter you'll find the following**:

1. Explanation of the
   - Algorithm
     - What it's good at doing
     - How it can be used to solve problems
     - Details behind implementation
     - Time and space complexity
   - If it is a data structure the course will also
     - Talk about the interface
     - How to use it
2. Common patterns and tricks related to the data structure or algorithm
3. Several example walkthroughs of relevant problems
4. Practice problems to help build muscle memory of was learned
5. Optional: bonus problems to help reinforce the ideas learned

## Who is this course for?

Increase one's skill and confidence in coding interviews.

Makes the presumption that one knows a common programming language (i.g. Python, C/CPP, Java, JavaScript).

Perfect for:

- Learning data structures and algorithms to pass coding interviews
- New to algorithm problems and want to build the core foundation
- Planning to start applying soon and need a refresher
- Computer science graduates who want to improve their skill in coding interviews
