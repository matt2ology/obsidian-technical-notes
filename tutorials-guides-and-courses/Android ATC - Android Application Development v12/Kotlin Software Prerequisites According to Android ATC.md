Topics : [Kotlin](Kotlin%20Programming%20Language.md)

One must install either of these two software as the prerequisite to start development
with Kotlin programming: "IntelliJ" or "Android Studio" as their
[Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](Integrated%20Development%20Environment.md) , and Java JDK to execute the Kotlin code.

## TL;DR: You need 2 things before developing with Kotlin

1. Have an [IDE](Integrated%20Development%20Environment.md) either of the following (or both):

   - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
   - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

2. Have a [Java JDK](../../_inbox/Java%20Development%20Kit.md) to execute Kotlin code.
