Has all the typical datatypes you'd expect to see

## String

Can be declared

- Implicitly: `val Name = "Fern"`
- Explicitly: `val Name:String = "Himmel"`

## Character

Implicitly Kotlin compiler considers single quotes ('s') as char: `val x = '$'`

Explicitly a character variable assignment is as follows: `val x =:Char = 's'`

## Booleans

```kotlin
val x:Boolean=true

fun main() {
    println(x)
}
```

## Numbers

| Data Type | Description                                         | Default Value |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Byte      | The byte data type is an 8-bit signed integer.      |               |
|           | Its value is from 0 to 255                          | 0             |
| Short     | The short data type is a 16-bit signed integer.     |               |
|           | Its value ranges from -32768 to 32767               | 0             |
| Int       | The integer data type is a 32-bit signed integer.   |               |
|           | It has values from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647 | 0             |
| Long      | The long data type is a 64-bit singed integer       | 0L            |
| Float     | The float data type is a single-precision           |               |
|           | 32-bit floating point                               | 0.0f          |
| Double    | The double data type is a double-precision          |               |
|           | 64-bit floating point                               | 0.0d          |

When you want to format, and get the value of, a particular variable in a quoted string
one can do the following

```kotlin
var price:Double = 10.05 // Explicitly double
var tax = 0.05 // Implicitly Double

fun main(){
    printlin("price = $price and tax = $tax")
}
```

> Outputs
>
> > price = 10.05 and tax = 0.05

One can also declare a data type for a variable first, and later assign its value from a specific
code operation.

```kotlin
fun main(){
    var first_name:String?=null // Explicitly declared as String with Null value
    println(first_name)
}
```

> Outputs
>
> > null

```kotlin
fun main(){
    var first_name:String?=null // Explicitly declared as String with Null value
    first_name = "Heiter"
    println(first_name)
}
```

> Outputs
>
> > Heiter

### Differences between Double and Float variables

Most use Double data type for variables which are expected to have a fraction value, for
double ensures a higher precision (64 bit) while Floats are single-precision (32-bit).

If any fraction value to any variable without declaring it explicitly, as Float, the Kotlin
compiler will consider it implicitly as Double data type.

**TL;DR**: fractions are stored as Double data types implicitly

## Array

```kotlin
fun main(){
    var x = arrayOf(5, 7, 9)
    println(x[0]) // Print the element in index 0
    println(x[1]) // Print the element in index 1
    println(x[2]) // Print the element in index 2
}
```

> Outputs
>
> > 5
> > 7
> > 9

```kotlin
fun main(){
    var x:IntArray = intArrayOf(5, 7, 9)
    println(x[2])
    x[2] = x[0] + x[1]
    println(x[2])
}
```

> This means that the array `x` now includes the following values: `[5, 7, 12]`
>
> Outputs
>
> > 9
> > 12

## Data Type Conversions

There are conversion functions that can be applied to variables

- `toByte()`
- `toShort()`
- `toInt()`
- `toLong()`
- `toDouble()`
- `toChar()`
- `toString()`

There are times you'd need to convert a data type for a variable to another data type.

```kotlin
fun main(){
    val x:Int = 55
    val y:Float = x.toLong()
    println("x = $x")
    println("y = $y")
}
```

> Outputs
>
> > x = 55
> > y = 55.0
