Fit for Android development.

1. **Performance**: with similar byte code structure Kotlin runs faster than Java. Kotlin is not as verbose as Java and so less code is needed and improves readability.
2. **Easy to learn and intuitive**: Since 2011, Kotlin has been worked on and is a mature language. Tooling, ecosystems, and integration into Android Studio has made it more assessable.
3. **Free integration with Android Studio**: Android Studio, an IDE, was designed with Kotlin in mind, as the main targeted program to be used when developing on Android platforms. This includes tooling, syntax highlighting, and features like converting Java code to Kotlin code.
4. **Interoperability**: Kotlin can be developed, and compiled, alongside Java as they both use the same JVM target. It's possible to create a project developed using both Java and Kotlin without fear of fully adopting Kotlin where the Java code not needed to be re-worked.
5. **Null safety**: In Java, since everything is pass-by-reference, there are possibilities where one may encounter Null Pointer Exceptions; in contrast, although interoperable with Java, Kotlin is null safe because it uses the safe call operator `?`.
6. **Support for multiplatform development**: Kotlin is a general purpose language and so it can target iOS, backend, and web applications; for example, if you want to make an existing project suitable for multiple platforms one would need to simply modify it to be compatible with iOS. Regardless of one's project, its scale, the existing Kotlin code will not prevent one from integrating [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](Kotlin%20Multiplatform%20Mobile).
7. **Code safety**: "Less code and better readability leads to less errors"... Kotlin isn't as verbose as Java is; in addition, the Kotlin compiler detects remaining errors, making the code safe.
8. **Big community**: Kotlin's programming community is an active one and has an established list of contributions, adoption rate, and many start-ups and Fortune 500 companies have already developed Android.

On top of that Google announced Kotlin as an official language for Android during Google I/O 2017.
