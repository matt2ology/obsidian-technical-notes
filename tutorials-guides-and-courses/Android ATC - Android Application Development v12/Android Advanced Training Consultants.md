Related : [Android ATC - Android Application Development v12](Android%20ATC%20-%20Android%20Application%20Development%20v12.md)

A subpar independent, not affiliated with Google, accreditation company that publishes
a PDF "e-book" accessible solely through their login portal, featuring a rudimentary web 
PDF viewer. The e-book exhibits numerous spelling, grammar, and code sample 
inconsistencies and errors.

Equally important, the PDF viewer lacks any distinguishing features or enhancements
(like the ability to take notes on the page or send to Kindle) to justify the premium $14
price tag associated with accessing it through a dedicated login portal.

3.5 stars out of 10 stars...

Sometimes your best isn't good enough try harder with v13.
