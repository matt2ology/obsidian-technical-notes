If you want to be in the hardware industry with undergrad it's difficult with just undergrad
degree.

If looking for software positions in the hardware side. Take at:

- [Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) - can do on your own
- [MITx: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python?index=product&queryID=3420e438ac2d916d1f5c8f3486fc69a0&position=1&results_level=first-level-results&term=introduction+to+computer+science+mit&objectID=course-956319ec-8665-4039-8bc6-32c9a9aea5e9&campaign=Introduction+to+Computer+Science+and+Programming+Using+Python&source=edX&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fsearch)

If you go into the software there will be more jobs.

If I start a career now with AI it will most likely in validation
and wait until the market turns up.

Hone your ability and learn as much as you can when you
take linear algebra.

Suggestion: focus up on Python if you'd like to go into the AI
revolution

No matter what you do is to be good with Python.

If you want to go into firmware dive into c or python. Learn Verilog to improve your chances
especially if you're looking to stay in the hardware world.

Practice [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) be proficient in Python.
There is always a demand for software developers.
