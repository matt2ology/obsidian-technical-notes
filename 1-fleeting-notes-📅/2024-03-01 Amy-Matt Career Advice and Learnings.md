## Agenda/Questions

1. Learn more about you  
   â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚1. Your experience.  
   â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚2. How do you learn/practice your technical experience and build confidence?  
   â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚3. As a manager how do you feel/hire for team dynamic?
2. Have any advice for me?

## Notes

Amy obtained her undergrad in 2.5 years.

Would I articulate if I am a solid software engineer (am I ready)?

- Would I be able to take on technical interviews

Internal network doesn't require too much technical evaluation; however, external will require more evaluation (just based on resume alone)

Difficult for first job may present a challenge...

Amy suggest that: don't worry the size of the company.
Any company to get a foot in the door.

BS Degree does not articulate independent research skill.
Grad school trains one to find solutions one their own.

Masters degree carries life long versus some certs.
Highlights well in resume. Enables the climb.

Develop mindset for continual learning.

One can argue that state positions maybe an alternative.

Good Morning Amy,

I'm glad you found my notes and summary a useful ability to have!

I appreciate your insights regarding potential career paths. Communication and organization are areas I value, and I'm open to exploring opportunities that leverage these skills.
Your suggestion about project or program management roles aligns well with my interests in process management and coordination.

I'll definitely keep Solidigm's Telemachus Program in mind for mentorship opportunities. Having guidance and support as I navigate my career path would be invaluable.

Thanks again for your email and for taking the time to chat with me last week, Amy.
I look forward to staying in touch and exploring potential opportunities both externally and, when positions are available, here at Solidigm.

Best regards,
Matt

Hi, Matt,

Glad to chat with you! Thanks for making notes and summarize the conversation. This is very good step!

From the conversation, I do feel you potentially can be good at communication, maybe good at organizing things. I am not sure how strong technically you are, but you can also consider project management, program management type of job if you prefer having a less technical, more towards to process management.

Yeah, please feel free to reach out to me in the future. Solidigm also has a Telemachus Program where you can pick a mentor to coach you.

Hi Amy,

I want to express my sincere gratitude for taking the time to meet with me earlier to
discuss career aspirations and provide insights into the software engineering field.

Our conversation isn't sugar coated and speaks directly to my fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
Your guidance and advice are in line with my personal mindset and to how I was raised.

Here's a summary of the key points we discussed:

- Perform a self-assessment to see that I am ready for an experienced software engineer role. Would I be able to handle myself well in technical interviews; otherwise, I will have to adjust my resume to better reflect my skills and abilities.

- Searching for a first job will have its challenges. Job hunting will be a full-time job in of itself, so be open to all opportunities regardless of the companyâ€™s size or prestige.

- Most people donâ€™t stay at their first jobs forever, so itâ€™s important to get your foot in the door and grow the abilities and build the skills required to be successful in my career.

- Donâ€™t stay in a comfort zone; for, it holds me back from the potential career advancement and life achievements.

- If you see yourself in further studying Computer Science it would be to my benefit to obtain a graduate degree; for, a graduate degree is lifelong in contrast to some certificate that will expire.

- A graduate program teaches one to be self-reliant, have independent research skills, and opens the door to career advancing opportunities.

- Carry forward the attributes of your team: have the mindset for continual learning and teaching.

With your permission, I would like to ask if it would be possible for me to continue reaching out to you for mentorship and guidance in the future.
Whether itâ€™s seeking advice on specific career decisions, discussing industry trends, or simply gaining insights from your experiences.
Iâ€™d be grateful for all I can learn, and benefit from your mentorship.

Once again, thank you for your invaluable advice and encouragement.
I am truly grateful for your mentorship and look forward to implementing your insights as I navigate my career journey.

Warm regards,
Matt
