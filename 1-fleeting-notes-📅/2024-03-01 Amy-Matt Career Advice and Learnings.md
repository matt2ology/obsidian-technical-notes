## Notes

Amy obtained her undergrad in 2.5 years.

Would I articulate if I am a solid software engineer (am I ready)?

- Would I be able to take on technical interviews

Internal network doesn't require too much technical evaluation; however, external will require more evaluation (just based on resume alone)

Difficult for first job may present a challenge...

Amy suggest that: don't worry the size of the company.
Any company to get a foot in the door.

BS Degree does not articulate independent research skill.
Grad school trains one to find solutions one their own.

Masters degree carries life long versus some certs.
Highlights well in resume. Enables the climb.

Develop mindset for continual learning.

One can argue that state positions maybe an alternative.
