## Notes

- Can't use the full bandwidth because of 8-bit data characters are treated as 3 bits and 5 bits mapped onto a 4-bit code group
- Is there a rhyme or reason to 2.5 GT/s, 5.0 GT/s, and 8.0 GT/s and higher?
  - It's because of the math done for [Encoding for 2.5 GTs and 5.0 GTs Data Rates](../_inbox/Encoding%20for%202.5%20GTs%20and%205.0%20GTs%20Data%20Rates.md)

## ARs

- Read up on PCIe Tree
