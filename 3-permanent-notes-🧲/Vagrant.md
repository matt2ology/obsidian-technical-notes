Is a framework that automates the process of creating and managing [Virtual Machines (VM)](<../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/Virtual%20Machine%20(VM).md>)
and supports multiple [Operating Systems](../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/Operating%20Systems.md)
across various platforms.

A "Vagrantfile" is the single framework specific configuration file that
describes the virtual environment in one's code used to create the local
infrastructure.

## Installation

Prerequisite: Make sure that your VirtualBox has "guest additions" installed on
it. "Guest additions" provide better driver support, port forwarding, and have
more options available.

1. Download: <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install>
2. Enter the following command in the terminal to install Vagrant plug-in for guest additions
   1. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`

It is good practice to update this plug-in anytime you upgrade Vagrant and VirtualBox.
