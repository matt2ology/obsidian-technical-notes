## Initial terminal screen loader setup

Setting up your screens

Have two terminals opened up with it's own node instance. The convention is that you have the a node instance named "LOADER-A" (i.e. node 1) and "LOADER-B" (i.e. node 2).

To set up two terminal instances (one left and one right) in your window

1. 11520 is your baud rate?
2. Left terminal Instance: `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 -S LOADER-A`
3. Right terminal Instance: `screen /dev/ttyUSB1 11520 -S LOADER-B`
