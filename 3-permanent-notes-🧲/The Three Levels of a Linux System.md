A Linux system has three main levels.

1. The _hardware_ level: implies all the "tangible" computer components that makes up the computer.
   1. Processor (CPU)
   2. Main Memory (RAM)
   3. Disks/Storage Devices
   4. Network Ports
2. The [kernel](Linux%20Kernel) is the core of the [Operating System](Operating%20Systems) (i.e. Software/programs that make up the main functionalities of an operating system).
   1. System Calls
   2. Process Management
   3. Memory Management
   4. Device Drivers
3. User Processes (i.e. main software and programs that the [OS](Operating%20Systems) executes/uses to run)
   1. Graphical User Interface
   2. Servers
   3. Shell
