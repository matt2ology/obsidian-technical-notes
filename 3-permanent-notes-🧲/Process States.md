While a process executes, over time it changes state

- new: Process is crated by loading from disk into memory
- running: Instructions are being executed on a CPU
- waiting: Process is waiting for some event to occur on its behalf; data input, or another
  event; may change priority while waiting
- ready: Process is waiting to be assigned to a processor (i.e. it is ready to run but not yet running, as it has not been granted a CPU)
- terminated: Process has completed execution; its whole memory space is being freed; all other resources will be re-acquired by [OS](../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/Operating%20Systems.md); PID will be purged

## Quote and Citation

the term state in reference to memory, processes, the kernel, and other parts of a computer system. Strictly speaking, a state is a particular arrangement of bits. For example, if you have four bits in your memory, 0110, 0001, and 1011 represent three different states. â€” location: [997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X7S1JMB&location=997) ^ref-17804
