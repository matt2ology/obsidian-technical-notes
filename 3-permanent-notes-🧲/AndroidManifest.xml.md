It's an XML file that contains all the metadata of the application
(i.e. a table of contents of the app).

It's fancy configuration file for the application and details how the app should
behave/function (e.g. what the app can do depending on the given permission settings).

It is located at the root of the project's directory: `app | manifests | AndroidManifest.xml`

It lists all the components and permissions the app uses.

Starting the app from the launcher, it also provides the entry points into your app.
