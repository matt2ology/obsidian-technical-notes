It's an XML file that contains all the metadata of the application; which is to say,
it's fancy configuration file for the application and details how the app should
behave/function (e.g. what the app can do depending on the given permission settings).

It is located at the root of the project's directory: `app | manifests | AndroidManifest.xml`
