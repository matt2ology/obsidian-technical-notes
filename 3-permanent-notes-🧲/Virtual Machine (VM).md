# Virtual Machine (VM)

Related : [Ansible](Ansible.md), [Vagrant](Vagrant.md)

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software simulation of a physical computer that runs
on an actual computer. It functions as an independent computer with its own
operating system and applications, even though it shares the physical hardware
with the main computer. This allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical
machine, making it possible to test software, run different operating systems,
or manage various environments simultaneously without needing extra physical devices.
