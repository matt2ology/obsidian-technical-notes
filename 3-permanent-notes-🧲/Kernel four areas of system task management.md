## Quote and citation

The kernel is in charge of managing tasks in four general system areas:

- Processes The kernel is responsible for determining which processes are allowed to use the CPU.
- Memory The kernel needs to keep track of all memoryâ€”what is currently allocated to a particular process, what might be shared between processes, and what is free.
- Device drivers The kernel acts as an interface between hardware (such as a disk) and processes. Itâ€™s usually the kernelâ€™s job to operate the hardware.
- System calls and support Processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel. â€” location: [1010](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X7S1JMB&location=1010) ^ref-62231
