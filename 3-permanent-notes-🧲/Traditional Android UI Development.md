Prior to Android 2022.2 XML files (e.g. `app/res/layout/activity_main.xml`)
were used to build the interface design.

The first app interface, `MainActivity`, has an XML file called: `activity_main.xml`.
This is used to build the [UI](../4-hub-notes-ðŸš‰/User%20Interface.md), the layout,
for the application. By modifying the `activity_main.xml` one can add widgets
(components) like images, textboxes, buttons, and others.

The Kotlin file `MainActivity.kt` is used to then configure the application code.

First create the components then develop the functionality.

## TL;DR

Traditionally, not the modern Jetpack Compose way to write Android applications

- `activity_main.xml` is used to create the look, feel, and structure
- `MainActivity.kt` is to create the functionality for the components/widgets
