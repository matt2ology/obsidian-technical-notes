# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Related : [DevOps](DevOps), [Configuration Management (CM)](<../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/Configuration%20Management%20(CM).md>), [Vagrant](../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/Vagrant.md) - [Why Use Code to Build Infrastructure](../Book%20Notes%20and%20References%20Library%20ðŸ“š/DevOps%20for%20the%20Desperate/Why%20Use%20Code%20to%20Build%20Infrastructure.md)

The process of using code to describe and manage infrastructure like [Virtual Machine (VM)](<../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/Virtual%20Machine%20(VM).md>),
network switches, and cloud resources (e.g. [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](<Amazon%20Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)>)).

Treating infrastructure as code allows one to build reusable components,
use test frameworks, and apply standard software engineering best practices.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be overkill; for example, if there is only one [Virtual Machine](<../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/Virtual%20Machine%20(VM).md>)
to set up or there is only one, simple, Bash script to run, it may not be worth either the time
or effort to create the infrastructure and [Configuration Management (CM)](<../3-permanent-notes-ðŸ§²/Configuration%20Management%20(CM).md>) of what can be
done in manually in 5 minutes.
