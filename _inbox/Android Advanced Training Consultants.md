A BS independent, not affiliated with Google, accreditation company that publishes
a PDF "e-book" accessible solely through their login portal, featuring a rudimentary web 
PDF viewer. The e-book exhibits numerous spelling and grammar inconsistencies and errors.

Moreover, the PDF viewer lacks any distinguishing features or enhancements (like the 
ability to take notes on the page or send to Kindle) to justify the premium $14 price tag
associated with accessing it through a dedicated login portal.
