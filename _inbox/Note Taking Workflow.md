## Note Taking Workflow 
#in-progress

### Technical Learning/Tutorial/Reference Notes

#### Books

 For books/tutorials make a "bibliographic" note that contains the book name/tutorial series
 - Name Convention : "\[author/channel name\] - \[title/tutorial series name\]"

### For Conceptual/Philosophy/Process Kind of Materials

Inspired by video : [morganeua - The FUN and EFFICIENT note-taking system I use in my PhD](https://youtu.be/L9SLlxaEEXY)

For books/articles/other media make a "bibliographic" note that contains the book name or as literature notes
 - Name Convention : "\[author/channel name\] - \[title/tutorial series name\]"

1. Other people's words (duh!)
 1. try using MLA format
  1. Blockquotes to distinguish the original extracted text vs your own words on passage
2. Don't just copy the quote, but write:
 1. Why this quote is interesting/why did it jump out
3. Paraphrases : documents an author's thoughts
4. Cliches and transition phrases
 1. Each note should be as small as possible and so no need for transitioning
