# Rust Cargo as Convention

When writing "simple" projects Cargo doesn't provide a lot of value over
`rustc`; however, as the program becomes more complex with multiple files, or
has dependencies, the value of using Cargo becomes more apparent when
spinning off a build.

For this reason, all that you will need to know when working with or building
Rust projects can be summarized with [Rust Cargo Key Commands](../Book%20Notes%20and%20References%20Library%20ðŸ“š/The%20Rust%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition/What%20are%20Rust%20Cargo%20Key%20Commands.md)

No 3rd party or specialized tool build chain: just `cargo build`.
