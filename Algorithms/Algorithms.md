# Algorithms

A set of instructions that a computer will follow step-by-step to solve a problem.

Algorithms are functions. It takes an input `x` and produces an output `y`.

> Algorithms take an input and produce an output. The output will be the answer to a question regarding the input.

Like a true function, an algorithm, should be 1:1 (i.e. one-to-one).

> Algorithms should be **deterministic**. Given the same **input**, the algorithm should **always** produce the same **output**. Basically, there shouldn't be any randomness.
